# greedy-algorithms

Greedy Algorithms is the answer of the problems in the course Algorithmic Toolbox Week 3.

This is a singular project for the collection of problems in substitution of the independent files that should be generated. 
The idea is to be able to reuse the code of the problems in the future.

Tests verify correct functionality and performance.

There is a static math class for number operations and other classes for different elements not 0-dimensional.
